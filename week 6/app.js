/* Closure  in Javascript
Closure is created when an inner function has access to its outer function variables and arguments.
  In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created.
   The inner function has access to â€“
1. Its own variables.
2. Outer function's variables and arguments.
3. Global variables.
